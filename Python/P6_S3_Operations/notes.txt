Basic S3 Conceptual Questions
Q1: What is Amazon S3?
A:
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a fully managed object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve unlimited data from anywhere on the internet. It's highly durable, scalable, and secure.

Q2: What are the main components in S3?
A:
The two primary components in S3 are:

Buckets ‚Äì Containers for storing objects.

Objects ‚Äì The actual data (files) stored in buckets along with metadata.

Q3: What is the difference between object storage and block storage?
A:

Object storage (like S3) stores data as objects with metadata and a unique identifier.

Block storage (like EBS) divides data into blocks and stores them individually.

Q4: What are S3 storage classes?
A:
S3 offers different storage classes based on access frequency and cost:

S3 Standard

S3 Intelligent-Tiering

S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

S3 One Zone-IA

S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

üîê Security and Access
Q5: How do you secure access to your S3 bucket?
A:

By using IAM policies and bucket policies

By enabling MFA delete and encryption

By restricting public access through block public access settings

Q6: What are bucket policies and how are they different from IAM policies?
A:

Bucket Policies are JSON-based permissions attached directly to the bucket.

IAM Policies are attached to users, roles, or groups and define what AWS resources they can access.

Q7: What is the default visibility of an S3 bucket and object?
A:
By default, all buckets and objects are private. Access must be explicitly granted.

üõ†Ô∏è Practical / Coding-Based Questions
Q8: Which Python library is used to work with S3 in AWS?
A:
boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services like S3.

Q9: What method is used to upload a file to S3 using boto3?
A:

python
Copy
Edit
s3.upload_file(local_file_path, bucket_name, object_name)
Q10: How do you download a file from S3 using Python?
A:

python
Copy
Edit
s3.download_file(bucket_name, object_name, local_download_path)
Q11: What happens if you try to delete a non-empty bucket in S3?
A:
You will get an error. You must first delete all objects in the bucket before deleting it.

Q12: How can you list all the objects in an S3 bucket?
A:
Using:

python
Copy
Edit
response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
for obj in response.get('Contents', []):
    print(obj['Key'])
‚ö†Ô∏è Error & Troubleshooting
Q13: What is NoCredentialsError in boto3?
A:
It occurs when your AWS credentials are not configured or not found. Use aws configure to set credentials locally.

Q14: What are some common errors you may face with S3?
A:

NoSuchBucket: When the bucket name is incorrect or deleted.

AccessDenied: When you lack the necessary permissions.

NoCredentialsError: AWS credentials not found or misconfigured.

üì¶ Advanced Questions
Q15: What is versioning in S3?
A:
Versioning allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object in a bucket.

Q16: What is a presigned URL?
A:
A presigned URL is a URL that gives temporary access to a private object in S3 without making it public.

Q17: Can you host a static website on S3?
A:
Yes, S3 supports static website hosting by enabling static website hosting and making the objects publicly accessible.

Q18: What is the maximum file size allowed for upload to S3 in a single PUT operation?
A:
The maximum is 5 GB per single PUT operation. For larger files (up to 5 TB), use multipart upload.

Q19: Can two buckets have the same name in different AWS regions?
A:
No, S3 bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts and regions.

Q20: How does S3 ensure data durability?
A:
S3 stores multiple copies of data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.
